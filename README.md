# weather-dashboard

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
Issue #1
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

Issue #2
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

Issue #3
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

Issue #4
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity

Issue #5
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
